# Workforce-Attrition-Analysis
# Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition patterns to help organizations understand workforce stability and identify key factors contributing to employee turnover. Using an interactive dashboard, the analysis highlights attrition trends across education fields, job satisfaction levels, salary ranges, tenure, and work-life factors, enabling HR teams to make informed retention decisions.

# Objective

The objective of this dashboard is to support HR leaders and management by:

Monitoring overall attrition volume and attrition rate

Identifying high-risk employee segments based on salary, tenure, and satisfaction levels

Understanding the impact of education background, job involvement, and work-life balance on attrition

Enabling data-driven retention strategies through interactive filtering by gender, performance rating, business travel, and time

# Description

The workforce dataset contains employee-level information related to:

Job Satisfaction, Job Involvement, Environment Satisfaction
